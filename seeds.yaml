      MUSOW is a conceptual and registry-style knowledge graph developed in the
      Polifonia project, modelling musicological concepts, vocabularies, and
      scholarly classifications using SKOS and related ontologies. While it is
      not an event-based KG, it is accompanied by curated SPARQL query examples
      and query guides, making it suitable for collecting runnable SELECT
      queries and generating natural-language question–SPARQL pairs.
